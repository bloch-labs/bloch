# Engineering

This folder contains **internal engineering documentation** for the Bloch compiler and runtime. 

It’s intended for contributors and maintainers (not end users).

## Structure

- `adrs/` — Architecture Decision Records (the *why* behind major technical decisions).  
- `designs/` — Design specs and proposals (the *how* and detailed plans that may evolve).  
- `reference/` — Technical reference docs explaining how things work.
- `templates/` — Reusable templates for ADRs, design docs.

## Getting Started

If you’re new: read `adrs/index.md`, then the relevant `reference/` docs for the subsystem you’re working on.
