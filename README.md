# Bloch — A Modern Open-Source Quantum Programming Language
> ⚠️ **Active development:** APIs, syntax, and tooling are still evolving and subject to change.

Bloch is a modern, strongly typed, interpreted quantum programming language from [Bloch Labs](https://bloch-labs.com). Paired with our upcoming **Bloch Studio** web IDE and circuit builder, it aims to *unify the quantum development stack* by offering a clean, language‑first, and vendor‑agnostic workflow that scales from research experiments to production circuits. By open-sourcing the core language, we invite the community to help build a sustainable, hardware-agnostic foundation for tomorrow’s quantum applications.
