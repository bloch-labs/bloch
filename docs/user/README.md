# Bloch User Guides

Use these docs to learn Bloch in a sensible order. Start with setup in `getting-started.md`, then skim the syntax overview in `language-tour.md`. From there, `types-and-data.md`, `control-flow.md`, and `functions-and-modules.md` cover everyday code. When you need the class system, read `classes-and-objects.md`. Quantum specifics live in `quantum-programming.md` and `annotations-and-tracking.md`. Keep `tooling-and-cli.md` handy for running programs and `examples.md` for runnable snippets. If you get stuck, check `troubleshooting.md`.
