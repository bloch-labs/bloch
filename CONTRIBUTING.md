# Contributing to Bloch

Thanks for helping shape Bloch! This guide keeps the contribution process simple while the language evolves rapidly.

---

## Before You Start
- We work from the `develop` branch; create feature branches from there and target it for pull requests.
- Please open or reference a GitHub issue so we keep discussion and tracking in one place.
- CI enforces formatting, testing, and Conventional Commit messages, so local checks save time.

---

## Environment Setup

### Prerequisites
- C++20-capable compiler (GCC ≥ 10, Clang ≥ 10, or MSVC 19.28+)
- CMake ≥ 3.16
- Git

### Build & Test

#### Linux & macOS
```bash
git clone https://github.com/bloch-labs/bloch.git
cd bloch
cmake -S . -B build -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release
cmake --build build --parallel
ctest --test-dir build --output-on-failure
```

Need debug symbols? Re-run the configure step with `-DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug`. The `bloch` binary lives in `build/bin/`; you can execute examples directly with `./build/bin/bloch examples/02_bell_state.bloch`.

#### Windows (Visual Studio)
```powershell
git clone https://github.com/bloch-labs/bloch.git
cd bloch
cmake -S . -B build -G "Visual Studio 17 2022" -A x64 -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release
cmake --build build --config Release --parallel
ctest --test-dir build --config Release --output-on-failure
```

These commands generate `build/Bloch.sln`, which you can open in Visual Studio for editing and debugging. Executables land under `build/bin/Release/` (or `build/bin/Debug/` when using `--config Debug`).

## Workflow Guidelines

### Branches
Use `type/issue-number` (such as `feat/142` or `fix/275`). If you are experimenting, feel free to work on a draft branch locally and rename it before opening a PR.

### Commits & PR Titles
CI expects Conventional Commits with an issue number suffix:

```
<type>(optional-scope): <summary> (#<issue>)
```

Examples: `feat: add runtime cache (#142)`, `fix(parser): handle trailing commas (#278)`. PR titles should mirror the final squash commit so release automation and changelog tooling stay in sync. If there is no issue yet, create one or coordinate with a maintainer so we can link the work.

### Pull Requests
1. Push your branch and open a PR against `develop`.
2. Fill in the PR template so reviewers know what changed and how you validated it.
3. Run the basic checks locally (`clang-format`, build, unit tests). Our GitHub workflows rerun them plus CodeQL analysis.
4. We use squash-merge to keep history tidy. The squash commit should match the Conventional Commit format above.

---

## Code Style & Tooling
- `.clang-format` defines the canonical style—run `clang-format -i <files>` or let your editor handle it.
- Prefer `snake_case` filenames, `PascalCase` types, and `camelCase` functions/methods.
- Tests live in `tests/`; add or update coverage when changing behaviour.

## Getting Help
- Open an issue on GitHub for bugs or feature discussions.
- Reach out at [hello@bloch-labs.com](mailto:hello@bloch-labs.com) if you need maintainer feedback or want to coordinate on larger work.

Happy coding!
