## ‚úÖ Code Style
- Adhere to the `.clang-format` file in the repo
- Set up auto-formatting on file save in your `.vscode/settings.json` file as follows
```json
"editor.formatOnSave": true,
"C_Cpp.clang_format_style": "file",
"[cpp]": {
   "editor.defaultFormatter": "ms-vscode.cpptools"
}
```
- Follow consistent naming conventions:
    - files: `snake_case.cpp`
    - classes: `PascalCase`
    - methods: `camelCase`
- You can format manually by running 
```bash
clang-format -i $(find . -regex '.*\.\(cpp\|hpp\|c\|h\)')
